# Data Science Midterm Project

## Project/Goals

In this project we took a dataset full of housing information from housing stock across different US State capital cities and built a regression model to predict prices. The goal was to build a high performing machine learning model that could accurately predict price, performing well when being tested on unseen data.

## Process
### Step 1: importing from .json
- In EDA.ipynb we accessed the directory of .json data files from the data folder to create a raw dataframe (Pandas/Python) full of the housing information.

## Results
(fill in how your model performed)

## Challenges 
(discuss challenges you faced in the project)

## Future Goals
(what would you do if you had more time?)
